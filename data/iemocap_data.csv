85.5106,89.9409,Ses02M_impro04_F007,neu,3.6667,2.3333,3,You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's

145.0661,155.5569,Ses02M_impro04_F011,neu,3,2,3.3333,"and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control."
155.645,159.2365,Ses02M_impro04_F012,neu,3,1.6667,3.6667,So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.

41.6743,54.6257,Ses02M_impro04_M007,fru,2,3.6667,3,"Yea, but it's - it's almost like it's not worth it you know, if I'm going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job, I mean once I actually do get the job it's like oh, retirement or something. I don't know, you know."
60.9668,66.365,Ses02M_impro04_M008,xxx,2.3333,2.3333,2.6667,"Well, and that's what I begin to question after a while is maybe I just don't want it, maybe it's not even worth it, you know, like"

30.47,36.5507,Ses02M_impro05_F004,neu,3,3,3,"Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but-"
38.1619,46.2674,Ses02M_impro05_F005,neu,2.5,3,3,"Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that"

111.7101,113.5505,Ses02M_impro05_F014,neu,2.5,2.5,2.5,So we'll- what we'll do

229.74,233.09,Ses02M_script01_1_F027,ang,2,3,4.5,I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
235.99,242.82,Ses02M_script01_1_F028,fru,1.5,4,4.5,That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. I mean you haven't seen her since you went away to war it's five years.

301.45,304.04,Ses02M_script01_1_F035,ang,2,3,4.5,Must you be inspired?
320.71,323.57,Ses02M_script01_1_F036,ang,2,3.5,4,"Tell me, you'd leave the business?"

16.54,24.3,Ses02M_script01_1_M002,xxx,2.5,2.5,4,About four this morning. I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked.
28.17,33.97,Ses02M_script01_1_M003,sad,2,3,3.5,I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.
34.95,38.97,Ses02M_script01_1_M004,sad,2.5,2.5,3.5,No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.
41.66,44.62,Ses02M_script01_1_M005,sad,2,2.5,3,I could hear him right through the floor in my room.
52.41,54.26,Ses02M_script01_1_M006,xxx,2,2.5,2.5,I guess he is.

68.38,73.29,Ses02M_script01_1_M008,xxx,2.5,3.5,4,Being dishonest with him. I mean that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.

233.1138,239.28,Ses05F_impro05_F026,fru,2,4,4.5,Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?
244.34,252.46,Ses05F_impro05_F027,fru,2,3.5,4,"Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me."
257.23,259.79,Ses05F_impro05_F028,fru,2.5,3,3.5,Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.
260.73,265.65,Ses05F_impro05_F029,xxx,2.5,4,4.5,"So I would have carried it on, but they made me check it and then they lost it."

355.76,358.78,Ses05F_impro05_F042,ang,1.5,4,4.5,It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.

373.39,375.85,Ses05F_impro05_F044,fru,2,3.5,3.5,"Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher."

185.28,188.7,Ses05F_impro05_M026,fru,3,2.5,3,That's what the cost of the ticket was for.
197.66,204.16,Ses05F_impro05_M027,fru,2.5,3,3.5,"Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-"

211.11,221.4,Ses05F_impro05_M029,fru,2.5,3,4,"Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher."
225.71,228.4669,Ses05F_impro05_M030,neu,3,3,3,"Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?"
229.6,233.56,Ses05F_impro05_M031,neu,2.5,3,3.5,"Well, my hands are really tied then."
238.79,245.45,Ses05F_impro05_M032,neu,3,3.5,4,"Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--"
250.96,258.66,Ses05F_impro05_M033,neu,2,3,4,"Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?"
259.25,262.14,Ses05F_impro05_M034,neu,3,3,3,"Uh, so it was really heavy."
264.9292,271.51,Ses05F_impro05_M035,fru,3,3,3.5,"Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher."
271.56,278.31,Ses05F_impro05_M036,neu,2.5,3,3.5,"I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you."
278.56,280.91,Ses05F_impro05_M037,neu,2.5,3,2.5,Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.
280.97,283.44,Ses05F_impro05_M038,fru,2.5,3,3,"Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here."
289.83,296.59,Ses05F_impro05_M039,neu,2.5,3,4,"Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-"
298,299.46,Ses05F_impro05_M040,neu,2.5,2.5,3,makes up?
301.53,304.58,Ses05F_impro05_M041,neu,3,3,3.5,"The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am."
306.9,313.58,Ses05F_impro05_M042,xxx,2.5,3,3.5,I've gone into the computer.  I told you exactly what I can see in the computer that your luggage did arrive here.
319.46,326.9644,Ses05F_impro05_M043,fru,3,3,4,"Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you."
326.98,329.3014,Ses05F_impro05_M044,fru,3,3,3,"I have no guarantee, absolutely not."
330.6,334.14,Ses05F_impro05_M045,fru,2.5,2.5,3.5,How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?
337.52,342.54,Ses05F_impro05_M046,fru,3,3,3.5,"Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?"
343.97,346.4064,Ses05F_impro05_M047,fru,2.5,3,3.5,"Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous"
355.62,357,Ses05F_impro05_M048,neu,3,3,2.5,Right.
358.1,365.26,Ses05F_impro05_M049,fru,2.5,3.5,4.5,"I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen."
365.3,370.53,Ses05F_impro05_M050,neu,2.5,3.5,4,"And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that."
371.63,374.16,Ses05F_impro05_M051,neu,3,2.5,2.5,So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?
375.1,385.14,Ses05F_impro05_M052,neu,3.5,3,3.5,"Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag."

I've been transferred to, like, eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department, and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it, and then that person doesn't know what's going on.  And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again."

I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue, something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again."

113.46,123.79,Ses05M_script01_1_F013,fru,2,3,4,"To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?"

240.48,244.02,Ses05M_script01_1_F026,neu,2,3,3.5,"Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women."
246.06,248.98,Ses05M_script01_1_F027,fru,2,3.5,3.5,"Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie."
250.09,255.58,Ses05M_script01_1_F028,fru,2.5,3,3.5,"Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean, you haven't seen her in five years."
263.77,282.02,Ses05M_script01_1_F029,fru,2,2.5,4,"No.  I don't want a -- look, your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now, what's going to happen to your father; do you know?  Because, I don't."
287.4,289.72,Ses05M_script01_1_F030,xxx,2.5,2,3,Just give it some more thought.

19.53,28.2,Ses05M_script01_1_M002,xxx,2,3,3.5,"I don't know, like, four o'clock this morning.  I heard a crack, and I woke up, and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it broke."

39.02,43.08,Ses05M_script01_1_M004,sad,2,3,3,No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.
44.98,47.96,Ses05M_script01_1_M005,xxx,2,3,3,I could hear him right through the floor in my room.
58.44,60.41,Ses05M_script01_1_M006,xxx,2,2,2.5,I guess he is.

69.45,73.91,Ses05M_script01_1_M008,xxx,2,3.5,3.5,Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.
74.42,81.9,Ses05M_script01_1_M009,fru,2,4,4,You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?
84.68,92.07,Ses05M_script01_1_M010,fru,2,4,4.5,I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.
92.08,103.14,Ses05M_script01_1_M011,ang,2,4,4,"Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?"
103.52,106.05,Ses05M_script01_1_M012,fru,2,3.5,3.5,We have to say it to him.
